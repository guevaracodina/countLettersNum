# countLettersNum
The 'cuentaLetrasNum' function starts with a random number between 1 and 99, counts the letters in its word representation, and iteratively continues this process. It stops when the number of letters matches the number itself or detects an alternating loop to prevent infinite cycles (e.g., between "cuatro" and "seis").
